# GuessingGame
A little guessing game for further practice developing console applications. 

This project was inspired by Giraffe Acadamy's Mike Dane C# video tutorial on Youtube, at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFe6BrtS-vw&list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpNIBTYHNDrhfE9C-imUXCmk&index=19.
I made some modifications to the project including the ability to start over when the game is over, and will revisit the project to make more updates.
